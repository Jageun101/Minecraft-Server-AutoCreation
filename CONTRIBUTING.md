## It's not complicated.

Here are the contribution conditions:
- If you have an idea that could be beneficial (whatever it is), you can add it.
- If you want to improve the organization of the code or make it cleaner, you can
- If you want to optimize and/or speed up the code, you can
- If you want to fix a bug, you can
- If you want to correct a detail you can
- If you want to make the program more compatible with other operating systems, you can.

Any other form of contribution is welcome, as long as you don't degrade the code (see [security](security.md)).
