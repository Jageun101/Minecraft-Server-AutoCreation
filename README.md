# Minecraft-Server-AutoCreation
creation and installation of a fully automated minecraft server.

## How to use
- Download the latest version of MSAC -> [Latest version](https://github.com/kerogs/Minecraft-Server-AutoCreation/releases/latest)
- Launch exe file
- Select version (the program will list the versions available to you (automatically updated))
- let the server create itself from A to Z

## Features
- Select the desired server version
- Download jar file on its own
- Create bat file by itself
- launch first run automatically
- Accept EULA automatically (make sure you've read them!)
- Create all server files alone
- Track program actions to see what it's doing (with nice colors âœ¨)

## Future updates to work on
- Choose between Spigot, Bukkit or vanilla
- repair known issues

## Known issues
- The program may fail to retrieve the list of versions (for X reason) and then close itself. Don't panic, just restart the program as many times as necessary (usually 1-3 times maximum).
